# MadSynth

 This is the repository for my synthesizer project. It's a personal project and also my bachelor's degree final work. The main goal of the project is the development of a low-cost, off-the-shelf parts based synthesizer using a jellybean microcontroller. The project is being log in my youtube channel. Extra documentation and code snippets can also be found here.
